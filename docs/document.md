This document describes the project work of the Combinatorial Decision Mak-
ing and Optimization course for the academic year 2024/2025, which is about
modelling and solving the Sports Tournament Scheduling (STS) problem. The
students can propose another problem from the literature provided that they get
our approval before starting work on it. The project work involves approaching
the problem using (i) Constraint Programming (CP), (ii) propositional SATis-
fiability (SAT) and/or its extension to Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT),
and (iii) Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MIP).

The students must form a group of 2-3 members, and it suffices for point
(ii) to develop a SAT or an SMT solution. If they do both, they obtain bonus
points. The students can also form a group of 4 members, but in that case they
need to develop both SAT and SMT solutions. A student who cannot form a
group must get our approval with convincing motivation.

1 Problem description

Organizing sports tournaments is a strategically important, yet complex task.
As sports continue to grow in commercial value and global popularity, the de-
mand to efficiently generate equitable tournament schedules has become increas-
ingly critical. As the combinatorial decision and optimization expert, students
are asked to solve the Sports Tournament Scheduling (STS) problem defined as
follows. A tournament involving n teams is scheduled over n − 1 weeks, with
each week divided into n/2 periods (assuming that n is even), and each period
consists of two slots. In each period of every week, a game is played between
two teams, with the team assigned to the first slot playing at home, while the
team in the second slot playing away. The goal is to decide the home and away
teams of all the games in a way that:

• every team plays with every other team only once;

• every team plays once a week;

• every team plays at most twice in the same period over the tournament.

An example schedule with 6 teams is shown in Table 1.

Period 1
Period 2
Period 3

Week 1 Week 2 Week 3 Week 4 Week 5
6 v 2
3 v 6
1 v 4
4 v 5
3 v 5
2 v 1

2 v 4
5 v 6
1 v 3

5 v 1
2 v 3
4 v 6

3 v 4
6 v 1
5 v 2

Table 1: A schedule of 15 games over 5 weeks.

Optional optimization Optionally, in addition to the decision problem stated
above, an optimization version can be implemented. In this case, the goal is to
balance the number of home and away games of each team, to ensure fairness
in the tournament. For instance, Table 1 shows a balanced schedule for n = 6.

2 Project work

The purpose of the project work is to model and solve the STS problem using (i)
Constraint Programming (CP), (ii) propositional SATisfiability (SAT) and/or
its extension to Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), and (iii) Mixed-Integer
Linear Programming (MIP). The students will decide themselves the decision
variables, the problem constraints and the optional objective function around
the problem description. The project work includes building models as well
as conducting an experimental study using different search strategies (where
applicable) to assess the performance of the solvers. The experimental study
should consider progressively larger values of n for which a solution can be
obtained within the time limit.

ATTENTION Since this is a well-studied problem in the literature,
we encourage the students to explore the established approaches. It is
important, however, to thoroughly understand and clearly explain the
chosen method, cite it appropriately, and implement it independently.

2.1 Project groups

The students must form a group of 2-3 members, and it suffices for point
(ii) to develop a SAT or an SMT solution. If they do both, they obtain bonus
points. The students can also form a group of 4 members, but in that case they
need to develop both SAT and SMT solutions.

The names of the group members and their e-mail addresses must be indi-
cated in the following sheet before project submission: https://shorturl.at/
rSfdR. The sheet can be used also to write down individual names in search for
partners and to form groups. A student who cannot form a group must get our
approval with a convincing motivation before start working on the project.

ATTENTION While group members may divide the implementa-
tion and report-writing tasks, each member remains fully responsible
for the project development decisions.

2.2 Project development

When developing the project, students should pay attention to the following:

• Start with the instance parameter, decision variables, domains, and then

constraints.

• For the optional optimization model, consider constraining the objective

function with tight lower and upper bounds.

• Though a trivial model is a good starting point, focus on the peculiarities
of the underlying optimization approach and try to come up with the best
model so as to be able to tackle the instances in the best possible ways.

• Investigate if there are any implied constraints that you can benefit from.

• Use global constraints to impose the main problem constraints and the

implied constraints in your CP model.

• Optimize the model/encoding size and minimize redundancy.

• Observe if any symmetry can be exploited to improve the model by adding
symmetry breaking constraints. When you add multiple symmetry break-
ing constraints, they should not conflict with each other (i.e., there must
be at least one solution satisfying all the symmetry breaking constraints).

• Investigate the best way to search (where applicable) which does not con-

flict with the symmetry breaking constraints.

• The CP model must be implemented in MiniZinc and run using at least
Gecode, whereas the SAT model must be implemented using at least Z3.
For both SMT and MIP models, students can use their favourite theo-
ries, solvers and languages. Bonus points are considered if the problem is
modelled with a solver-independent language, so as to try different solvers
without rewriting the model. MiniZinc should be avoided here: mod-
els automatically derived from a MiniZinc model will not be considered.
Students are welcome to exploit different solver parameter configurations.

• Set a time limit of 5 minutes (300 secs) to interrupt solving, as some
instances may be too difficult to solve. Students are encouraged to apply
best practices to obtain a solution and, in the case of the optimization
version, to improve the quality of the solution, within the given time limit.

• If any pre-solving technique is used before invoking a solver then include

the time taken for pre-solving in the reported total runtime.

• All solvers should be used in their sequential version; solvers cannot be

run using multiple cores.

2.3 Project report

The students should describe clearly their work in a report by explaining the
modelling choices, presenting the experimental study and commenting on re-
sults. While a MiniZinc notation could be acceptable to describe a CP model, it
is required in general to use propositional logic, first-order logic and appropriate
mathematical notations. Do not copy and paste code! The experimental
results should show the total time took to obtain a solution for solved instances,
and in the optimization case the solution quality obtained by the time limit.

ATTENTION It is mandatory to produce one single report follow-
ing the template provided in the Virtuale page. The report should
be written in LATEXusing \documentclass{article} without changing
fonts, font size and margins. The page limits is 12 pages with three op-
timization approaches and 15 pages with all the approaches, excluding
the authenticity and the author contribution statement and the refer-
ences. You can use www.overleaf.com/ to produce a shared LATEXdocument.

2.4 Solution format

Collect all the solutions under a res folder, by creating specific sub-folders
(res/CP, res/SMT, res/MIP, etc.)
to store the results of each optimization
technology. For all the instances solved by a given model, you must present a
corresponding .json file. For instance, the results of your CP model on instance
#6 should be placed under the path res/CP/6.json. The keys of each .json
file are the approach names presented in the experimental results of the report.
Use meaningful names and be coherent with what you present in the report.

Each approach must be documented with its runtime (time, an integer), op-
timality state (optimal, a Boolean true iff the instance is solved for the decision
version, or solved to optimality for the optimization version), objective function
value (obj, a positive integer), which is set to None without an objective func-
tion, and the actual solution (sol). For the time field, use the floor of the actual
runtime (e.g., if the actual runtime is 42.7s then time = 42). If an approach un-
expectedly terminates before the timeout (300s) without solving to optimality,
then set the time field to 300. In this way, time = 300 ⇐⇒ optimal = f alse.
The sol field must be an (n/2) × (n − 1) matrix, represented as a list of
lists, where each matrix entry is a list of two teams playing at home and away,
in a given period and week. For example, the solution shown in Table 1 is
represented as:

[

[[2 , 4] , [5 , 1] , [3 , 6] , [3 , 4] , [6 , 2] ]
[[5 , 6] , [2 , 3] , [4 , 5] , [6 , 1] , [1 , 4] ]
[[1 , 3] , [4 , 6] , [2 , 1] , [5 , 2] , [3 , 5] ]

]

An example .json file looks as follows:

{

"gecode":
{

"time": 200,
"optimal": true,
"obj": 1,
"sol" : [ [[2 , 4] , [5 , 1], ...

},
"chuffed":
{

"time": 300,
"optimal": false,
"obj": 3,
"sol" : [ [[1 , 3] , [4 , 6], ...

},
"gecode_symbreak":
{

"time": 100,
"optimal": true,
"obj": None,
"sol" : [ [[1 , 3] , [4 , 6], ...

}

}

Before the project submission, the correctness of the computed solutions
must be checked with the solution checker (check_solution.py), which will be
available on the Virtuale page. You are not allowed to make any modifications
to the checker.

2.5 Project submission

The project will be submitted via Virtuale, and it shall contain the report and
the results (as described in Sections 2.3 and 2.4), as well as the source code under
a source folder, by creating specific sub-folders (source/CP, source/SMT, etc.)
To be reproducible, the source code must be executable through Docker.
Inside the code folder, there must be the Dockerfile to build the Docker image,
along with a README containing the instructions to run each of your mod-
els. The instructions should concisely explain how to reproduce the result of a
single model on a specific instance, without modifying the source code of your
project; for instance, you could provide a script that takes as input arguments
the instance number and/or the approach chosen. Moreover, you should also
provide a way to run all the models on all the possible instances automatically,
aiming to generate all the feasible results with a single operation. The choices
for the instructions format and the implementation of the Docker environment
are completely up to you.

Keep in mind that the solvers need to be executed inside the Docker container
defined by your Dockerfile, and not just in your local machine. Therefore,
it is strongly suggested to use free software only.
If commercial software is
used, ensure reproducibility through Docker on another machine; alternatively,
provide an open source alternative that can reproduce results. If neither of these
conditions are met, the solution will not be considered valid.

ATTENTION All the sources needed to reproduce the experi-
ments (e.g., .mzn, .dzn, .smt2 files) must be uploaded. Any submission
where the .json files containing the solutions:

• cannot be processed by the checker, or

• contain errors reported by the checker

will be automatically rejected.

Name your submission folder as CDMO Proj LastnameName1 ... LastnameNameK

and upload its tgz or zip compressed archive. When working as a group, it
suffices that only one group member submits the project, provided that the
following information is provided in the submission comments:

• all the members’ names, lastnames and UniBo e-mail addresses;

• the impossible dates and time for discussion due to a hard constraint (like
another exam, medical appointment, employment, urgent family matter).

3 Project discussion and course assessment

Group members will be invited for an oral discussion of the project with one
of the course teachers. No additional presentation is required. At each exam
session, there will be a single date for submission and multiple dates for dis-
cussions. The discussion schedule will be devised taking into account students’
hard constraints and will be communicated some days after the submission.

Important dates

• July 2025: Submission 06/07, discussions during the week of July 14

• September 2025: Submission 06/09, discussions during the week of Septem-

ber 15

There will be other exam sessions in December 2025 and February 2026. Those
who have not yet discussed by February 2026 will be able to submit later with
the risk of having to wait until the summer of 2026 for discussion. Discussions
will take place online on Teams.

The project evaluation will be based on the students’ ability to model and
solve a combinatorial optimization problem using the approaches and the tools
discussed in the course, as well as the ability to present their work. Particular
attention will be given to the literature search, originality, technical quality, and
clarity of presentation. While it suffices to produce either a SAT or an SMT
encoding for groups of max 3 students, bonus points will be given to those who
produce both. Groups of 4 students are required to produce both. Bonus points
will be given also to the groups that implemented the optimization version in
addition to the decision version.

As part of the course assessment, students will be asked oral questions on
the course topics during the project discussion. A successful overall evaluation
will result in a mark between 18 and 30L.

A group member may reject the proposed mark and re-submit the project
only once.
In that case, the project can be discussed again only by the re-
submitting group members and no new members can be added to the project.
The final mark after the re-assessment may be higher, the same, or lower than
the original mark, depending on the quality and significance of the revision.
